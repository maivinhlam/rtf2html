I would like to submit an abstract that include lots of Ca2+ and Mg2+ as well as some interesting results on Vrev that may or may not be of any value whatsoever. The point is that when there are some results, one must publish them or suffer the fate of Reneé Dècartes or perhaps Kopernicus. It is not as simple as introducing a few variables of ? ? and ? in an abstract equation that the values and provides an Å value, or perhaps â or ê but I can’t find how to insert a bar, but there is a S as a symbol font.? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
